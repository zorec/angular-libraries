All Angular 2+ libraries in one place
===

Searching for the libraries in Angular 2+ is not as easy because there might be results related only to the Angular 1.  
Therefore, the purpose of this document is to list the libraries available for the Angular 2 and higher.

Are you missing something here? Submit a pull request to add it.
Is there some library/module included although it shouldn't (because it works only with ng1, it is just a sample project, etc.)? Or do you have suggestions? Open an issue.
